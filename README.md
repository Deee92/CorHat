Hi there, I'm CorHat. I share information on COVID-19 and testing in Sweden.

How may I help you?

**what can you do for me**

I can help you book a test for COVID-19. I can also share general information about COVID-19.


**I need general information about covid-19**

I can tell you about the common symptoms, antibody and PCR tests, safety measures, and official government helplines for COVID-19. What would you like to know?

**what are the common symptoms of covid-19**

Possible symptoms for COVID-19 include head ache , sore throat , fever , cough , difficulty breathing , fatigue and no symptoms, which means some cases may even be asymptomatic.

Do you have more questions?

**how can I keep myself safe from covid-19**

The best way to avoid being infected with COVID-19, is to follow social-distancing norms, and good hand-hygiene.

Do you have more questions?

**I want to book a test**

Let's start with your current health condition. Can you please describe your symptoms?

**I have a fever and a headache and a sore throat**

Okay, can you tell me how long you've been experiencing this?

**5 days**

I see, it has been about 5 days

Do you think you may have had contact with a person infected with COVID-19?

**yes possibly**

Which of your close contacts tested positive?

**my partner tested positive for covid-19**

I see. You have had contact with your mother, who tested positive for COVID-19.

So, in conclusion, you have fever , headache and sore throat for 5 days, and you've been in contact with your mother, who tested positive for COVID-19.

Because you have ongoing symptoms and have had contact with a COVID-19 patient, I'd recommend you to take a PCR test.

Can I help you book your test?

**yes**

You can get tested in Stockholm , Link√∂ping , Gothenburg , Uppsala and Lund. Which would you prefer?

**I can take the test in uppsala**
